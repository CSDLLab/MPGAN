# MPGAN

Implementation of the paper **Using Simulated Training Data of Voxel-level Generative Model to Improve 3D Neuron Reconstruction**. 

## Introduction

In this paper, we propose a novel strategy of using two-stage generative models to simulate training data with voxel-level labels (MPGAN). Trained upon unlabeled data by optimizing a novel objective function of preserving predefined labels, the models are able to synthesize realistic 3D images with underlying voxel labels. The framework of MPGAN model is shown as follow:
